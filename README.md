pjas project on ml algorithm on spam mail detection
21-11-2024 -> I am attemtping to make a spam mail detection system/algorithm for a PJAS science project so far I have built the base python program and given users detail on what they should be doing at the terminal, so even the noobiest of the noobs(me) can understand how to use this program and pray that they dont have a virus ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
